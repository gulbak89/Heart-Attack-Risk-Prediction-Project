Heart Attack Prediction Project README

Dataset Selection

•	Dataset: Heart Attack Prediction Dataset

•	Description: This dataset contains information on 8763 patients, including attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking habits, exercise patterns, and dietary preferences. The target output, stored in the column 'Heart Attack Risk', indicates the likelihood of a patient having a heart attack.

•	Purpose: Analyzing these variables helps understand heart health and risk factors, aiding in preventive measures and early intervention.

Problem Statement

•	Imbalanced Dataset: Addressing the challenge of imbalanced data in the target variable.

•	Machine Learning Algorithm Selection: Determining the best algorithm for heart attack prediction.

•	Tools and Methods: Identifying the tools and methods for data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

Approach

1.	Feature Engineering: Performed feature engineering to enhance model performance.
	
2.	Imbalanced Dataset Handling: Employed oversampling techniques to address imbalanced data in the target variable.
   
3.	Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilized Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms for heart attack prediction.
   
4.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Applied hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques to optimize model performance.
   
5.	Model Evaluation: Selected the best model from each algorithm based on train accuracy, test accuracy, and AUC score.
	
6.	Best Model Selection: Identified Random Forest as the best-performing model, with lower overfitting and higher AUC score.
   
Tools and Libraries
